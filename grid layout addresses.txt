can have the url (up until '?utm_source=generator') be replaced, have all playlist urls in a dictionary and cycle through them

bigger picture ideas (maybe you should be taking care of yourself instead of looking at VS code)
 - have 3 dictionaries, one for album and game and for spotify
 - or game and album get their own template because they are the most similar
 - dictionaries would contain the art link, the source link (ei bandcamp page or steam) and then a little writeup that could show up in a popup when clicking on the art
